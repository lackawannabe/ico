this is a collection of 32x32 pixel art icons for my traffic signal maps



icons with =.; symbols in the names are designed to work with geometry layers that have coalesced information attributes

for example:

trafficsignal=Crouse_Hinds;Type_R;Black;h;b;fr.x.fr;c.c.c

is an icon with these properties:

manufacturer =	Crouse_Hinds	(signal manufactured by Crouse Hinds)

model =					Type_R				(manufacturer's designation is Type R)

color =					Black					(signal color is black)

body = 					h 						(signal is in horizontal orientation)

type = 					b 						(signal is used as a beacon)

arrangement = 	fr.x.fr 			(section arrangement is flashing red / blank section / flashing red)

visor = 				c.c.c					(visor arrangement is cutaway / cutaway / cutaway)
