Project ROLL: a map that i put tens of thousands of pictures onto via the exif data within the file

note!!!s:
i made these icons for my map to describe what type of camera the photo was taken with (stored in exif data)
these are designed specifically to be used for 16x16 pixel icon applications, and they look all bad and stinky if used in any other size
images used for each model of phone are (to the best of my ability) sourced from companies' product and advertising images, but who knows i probably made a mistake somewhere so whatevs i guess
